# Server-Utils-with-xlysander12
Me and my friend created a bot that have many functions and we would appreciate it if you test or see it, it will help us a lot and we want to make this bot grow in the community in order to help people with handling server.
Here is the link to get to his post and work: https://github.com/xlysander12/Server-Utils/blob/master/README.md
# About us
Basically we are students, going to learn programming soon (but he knows how to do certain things), and to start our journey, we want to make something by ourselves. We are excited to have this opportunity, hopefully this project goes well. Xlysander12 will be in charge of the programming the bot and I will be in charge of the art work and ideas.
We both have the same authority, working as a team and help each other out.

If you have anything to say to us, leave a comment, we appreciate it. Thanks for viewing this post.
